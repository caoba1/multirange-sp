# multirange-sp

Multiple range sliders, modified from an [article](https://css-tricks.com/multi-thumb-sliders-particular-two-thumb-case/) by Ana Tudor and with input from [multirange.js](https://leaverou.github.io/multirange/). Functionality has been added to have a plural number of sliders with different Ids in the same DOM.
